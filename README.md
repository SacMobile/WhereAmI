# WhereAmI
I recently spoke at the Women Who Code Sacramento Meetup. This was the demo app that we worked on in the Beginning iOS Development series.

This repo contains the master branch + 3 branches. 

## Master
Contains the starter project, with all basic interface elements in place.

## Step2
This branch contains all of the changes made during the second phase of the app buuld. All interface elements have been configured, add the CoreLocation framework and the MapKit framework have been added to the project.

## Step3
This branch contains all the changes made during the third phase of the app build. The UITextField's delegate has been wired up, and the UIButton's Target/Action has been set. After the UITextField dismisses the keyboard, a UIAlertController pops up a message containing the text from the UITextField.

## Step4
This branch contains all the changes made during the fourth phase of the app build. The user's current location is reverse geo-coded and displayed in a UIAlertController.
